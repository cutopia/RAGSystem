In progress!

Next steps:

implement chat memory

hook up the radio buttons to switch prompts and temperatures behind the scenes to support the different generation modes

improve the crusty appearance of the web interface

How about support for multiple concurrent users? Will have to be a waiting queue though or my hardware will catch fire.
