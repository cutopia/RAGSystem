In progress!

Next steps:

implement chat memory

hook up the radio buttons to switch prompts and temperatures behind the scenes to support the different generation modes

improve the crusty appearance of the web interface

We have sessions now for multiple users, but still need a waiting queue for the actual LLM or my hardware will catch fire.
